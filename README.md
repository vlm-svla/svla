## Install
This code is built from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA)

1. Clone this repository and navigate to svla folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlm-svla/svla.git
cd svla
```

2. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n svla python=3.10 -y
conda activate svla
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

3. Install additional packages for training cases
```
pip install -e ".[train]"
# -----------------------------------------
# add these if you face some issues when installing flash-attention
# export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# -----------------------------------------
pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1 --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir
```

### Install TTS for inferent
You need to install [MeloTTS](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS) for inference. We edit TTS to suitable with our environment. You can install by following:

```bash
cd MeloTTS
pip install -e .
python -m unidic download
cd ../
```


## LLaVA Weights
To use SVLA, download the required model weights:
```bash
mkdir weights
wget  -P ./weights/ https://huggingface.co/svla-vlm/svla/resolve/main/svla-sft-text-ins.zip 
unzip ./weights/svla-sft-text-ins.zip -d ./weights/
wget -P ./weights/ https://huggingface.co/fnlp/AnyGPT-speech-modules/resolve/main/speechtokenizer/ckpt.dev 
wget -P ./weights/ https://huggingface.co/fnlp/AnyGPT-speech-modules/resolve/main/speechtokenizer/config.json
wget -P ./weights/ https://huggingface.co/fnlp/AnyGPT-speech-modules/resolve/main/soundstorm/speechtokenizer_soundstorm_mls.pt
```

## Demo
We are currently developing a Gradio demo.
In the meantime, you can try a simple demo using:
```python
python inference_vlm.py
```
